# jumpcursor.vim
## **THIS PLUGIN IS AN EXPERIMENTAL ONE.**

With this plugin, you can move cursor anywhere you want.  
This behavior is similar [vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion) or [vim-searchx](https://github.com/hrsh7th/vim-searchx).

The key concept of this plugin is that you can move cursor anywhere you want without moving your eyes and by typing a letter twice.

## NOTE
This plugin only support Neovim.  
But if this experiment is good for me, I'll support Vim.

## Usage
Please add your own mapping and use it.  
Then you can chose mark that you want to move.

```vim
nmap [j <Plug>(jumpcursor-jump)
```
